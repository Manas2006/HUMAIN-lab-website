    "about": {
      "title": "About the Lab",
      "paragraph1": "The research in the lab is naturally interdisciplinary. In addition to traditional backbone subjects of machine learning (e.g., deep learning, statistics, optimization), we also gain inspiration from social sciences including economics and psychology about how we could model human preferences and behaviors, and develop rigorous human-subject studies to evaluate machine learning systems and algorithms.",
      "paragraph2": "We hope to develop a question-driven instead of a tool-driven research culture in the lab. Thus, our research can be theoretical or empirical, and the technical toolkits we use are diverse, ranging from statistical learning theory to sequential decision-making to causal inference to control theory."

    "workLifeBalance": {
      "title": "Work-Life Balance",
      "description": "The lab values the importance of work-life balance. Given that we are in such a fast-paced field, it takes great effort to keep some time and space for ourselves outside research. To maintain a sustainable working style, we hope to keep the lab small but vibrant."
