# New Paper Accepted at CHI 2024

We're excited to announce that our paper "Advancing Human-AI Collaboration Through Transparent Interfaces" has been accepted to CHI 2024!

## About the Paper

This work presents a novel framework for designing transparent AI interfaces that enhance human understanding and collaboration with AI systems. We conducted user studies with over 200 participants to validate our approach.

## Key Contributions

- A new framework for transparent AI interface design
- Empirical validation through user studies
- Open-source implementation available on GitHub

## Next Steps

We'll be presenting this work at CHI 2024 in May. Stay tuned for more updates!
