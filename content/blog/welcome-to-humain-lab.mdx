# Welcome to HUMAIN Lab

We're thrilled to launch our new website and share our research with the broader community. HUMAIN Lab focuses on developing ethical AI systems that enhance human capabilities and create positive societal impact.

## Our Mission

Our research lab is dedicated to advancing human-centered artificial intelligence through innovative technology solutions. We believe that AI should augment human intelligence, not replace it, and we work to ensure that AI systems are designed with human values at their core.

## What We Do

We conduct cutting-edge research across multiple domains:

- **Responsible AI**: Developing ethical frameworks and practices
- **Human-AI Interaction**: Designing intuitive interfaces and interaction paradigms
- **Evaluation + Safety**: Creating comprehensive evaluation methods
- **Systems + Deployment**: Bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment

## Join Us

We're always looking for talented researchers, students, and collaborators who share our vision. If you're interested in joining our lab or collaborating with us, please reach out!
